# build-flash-attention-3

Pre-built Linux wheels for [FlashAttention-3](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), fast
and memory-efficient attention kernels optimized for NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, across Python, PyTorch,
CUDA, and CPU architectures.

## Installation

Following the PyTorch convention, artifacts are published to a separate index for each CUDA
version. Each ABI3 wheel has a local version suffix that identifies the CUDA and PyTorch versions it
was built against, such as `flash-attn-3==3.0.0b1+cu.12.8.torch.2.10`, and requires the matching
PyTorch minor release.

Pre-built wheels are available on [Astral's GPU indexes](https://wheels.astral.sh/index.html).
For example, to install a CUDA 12.8 build:

```console
$ uv add flash-attn-3 --index astral-cu128=https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/
```

This configures the index and uses it as the source for `flash-attn-3`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
flash-attn-3 = { index = "astral-cu128" }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "astral-cu128"
url = "https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/"
```

Or, with `uv pip`:

```console
$ uv pip install --index https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/ flash-attn-3
```

## Supported versions

Wheels are available for the following `flash-attn-3` versions:

- [`3.0.0b1`](https://github.com/astral-sh-build/build-flash-attention-3/releases/tag/v2.8.3-r6),
  built from FlashAttention source revision
  [`b3f437fb`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/commit/b3f437fbcbeb0dd38e838cae418cfec3fb3e8fa9)

The latest build release, `v2.8.3-r6`, publishes FlashAttention-3 3.0.0b1 for the following
combinations:

| PyTorch | Python    | `x86_64` CUDA    | `aarch64` CUDA   |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 2.4.1   | 3.9–3.12  | 12.4             | —                |
| 2.5.1   | 3.9–3.12  | 12.4             | —                |
| 2.6.0   | 3.9–3.12  | 12.4             | —                |
| 2.7.1   | 3.9–3.13  | 12.8             | 12.8             |
| 2.8.0   | 3.9–3.13  | 12.8, 12.9       | 12.9             |
| 2.9.1   | 3.10–3.13 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 |
| 2.10.0  | 3.10–3.14 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 |
| 2.11.0  | 3.10–3.14 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 | 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 |
| 2.12.1  | 3.10–3.14 | 13.0, 13.2       | 13.0, 13.2       |

The wheels target Hopper's SM90a instruction set. CUDA 12.6 builds are intentionally omitted
because the `ptxas` bundled in the PyTorch build image crashes while compiling SM90a kernels.
